            <h1>About Ayrielle Ross</h1>
            <p>I am Ayrielle and I am from the US. My professional career is mainly Administrative and HR.<br>
            <br>However, I’ve always wanted to transition into the tech world but I wasn’t sure exactly what I wanted to do.<br>
                I did my research and realized I wanted to study web development. In doing my research, I stumbled upon Code first girls and was elated when I found out you can enter the boot camp with no experience.<br>
            <br>have learned a tremendous amount of information and would encourage any woman wanting to get into this field to apply.
